# GatorBall
Sprint 1 10-8-2024 to 10-25-2024:
Work Completed: This sprint we focuses on the front end of our design. We worked on showing dummy data and making the program that the referee will be using when determining the position of the football. We also wrote code for our ESP-32 and the DW3000 that uses Ultra Wide Band technology to track positioning using anchor points. However, we were unable to test it due to the fact that the shipping is taking longer than expected.
